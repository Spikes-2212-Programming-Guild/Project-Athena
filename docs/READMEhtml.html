    A program for showing our robot to kids. <br>
    This project let them write a simple code to drive the robot around and surpass obstacles that stand in its way.
    <br>
    The kids leans to code basic Java programs by calling the pre-written functions like `moveForwardInSeconds`,
    `turnLeftInAngle`, and others. <br>
    based on <a href="https://github.com/Spikes-2212-Programming-Guild/Freshman-Presentation-2021">this</a> code.

    <h2>If you want to use it, you can!</h2>
    <h3>All you have to do is:</h3>
    <li>Change the ports in the <code>RobotMap.java</code>.</li>
    <li>Change the correction of each side of the drivetrain in <code>subsystems/Drivetrain.java</code>.</li>
    <li>Change the type of the gyro and motorController if necessary.</li>

    <b>Now, all the user has to do is to write in </b> <code>Program.java</code> <b> the commands that they want the
    robot
    to do, and thats it!</b>
    <h2>The Commands that the user can call are:</h2>
    <li><code>moveForwardInSeconds(double seconds)</code></li>
    <li><code>moveBackwardInSeconds(double seconds)</code></li>
    <li><code>turnLeftInDegrees(double degrees)</code></li>
    <li><code>turnRightInDegrees(double degrees)</code></li>
    <li><code>turnLeftInSeconds(double seconds)</code></li>
    <li><code>turnRightInSeconds(double seconds)</code></li>
