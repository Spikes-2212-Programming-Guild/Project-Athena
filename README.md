# Project-Athena
A program for showing our robot to kids. <br>
This project let them write a simple code to drive the robot around and surpass obstacles that stand in its way. <br>
The kids learn to code basic Java programs by calling the prewritten functions like `moveForwardInSeconds`, `turnLeftInAngle`, and others.


<b>All the user has to do is to write in </b> <code>Program.java</code> <b> the commands that they want the robot to do, and thats it!</b>
<h2>The Commands that the user can call are:</h2>
<li><code>moveForwardInSeconds(double seconds)</code></li>
<li><code>moveBackwardInSeconds(double seconds)</code></li>
<li><code>turnLeftInDegrees(double degrees)</code></li>
<li><code>turnRightInDegrees(double degrees)</code></li>

<h2>If you want to use it, you can!</h2>
<h3>All you have to do is:</h3>
<li>Change the ports in the <code>RobotMap.java</code>.</li>
<li>Change the correction of each side of the drivetrain in <code>subsystems/Drivetrain.java</code>.</li>
<li>Change the type of the gyro and motorController if necessary.</li>
